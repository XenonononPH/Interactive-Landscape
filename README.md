# Interactive Landscape Summmary
Color Bubbles is a simple interactive canvas that portrays color theory. You start with 20 bubbles that either contain red, green or blue color, and each time you click within the canvas, a random colored bubble will appear. Its direction, size and speed are randomized. The colors blend and generate another color whenever they collide.
